Assignment 3

The inputs for this assignment are the right arrow key to move right,
and the space key to jump. The player will return to idle when nothing is
being pressed. The player will run into a wall when the level is over
and will stop moving forward but will still be trying to run. All images used
are in the Images File and are from various free sources on google. There are
two background elements, trees and mountains that both loop. The tiles are
read in through the tiles.map file.
