# Compiler
CXX = g++

# Compiler and linker flags. It's not the end of the world if you don't know which
# is which, but you may need to modify the compile statements as a result.
#   Note: If you're up to the challenge, I left my compiler flags here. It adds way
#   more warning flags, and uses the -Werror flag, meaning the program won't compile
#   if it finds a warning...
CXXFLAGS = `sdl2-config --cflags` -std=c++17 -ggdb3 -Wall  #Add more flags as you see fit!
# CXXFLAGS = -`sdl2-config --cflags` std=c++17 -ggdb3 -Wall -W -Werror -Weffc++ -Wextra -pedantic
LDFLAGS = `sdl2-config --libs` -lm -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_ttf

# For the include statements, the compiler needs to know where the .h files are
# located at! For many files, it knows by default, but for SDL, since this is not
# standard C++, we have to tell the compiler. This is what the sdl2-config part is
# about. We can also tell the compiler where our .h files are so the .cpp files
# don't have to look for them! If you make ./include directory and put all your .h
# files in there, then you can always include them in any source file, regardless
# of where it is located in the directory structure!
INCLUDES = -I ./include -I `sdl2-config --prefix`/include/

# Executable name.
# NOTE: If you change the name to include a filepath, it will put the executable
#       at that location. Use that to get the executable in the right position
#       for finding any other files like images!
