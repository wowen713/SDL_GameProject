# SDL_GameProject
These are two games that I made for my 2D Game Engine Construction Class

The Class Assginment was done individually for the first part of the semester to get familiar with SDL2.

The Rocket-Men-Game-Master was done with a team of three, one art designer, who created the sprites and images for the game,
one coder, this was my role which was to implement most of the features, and a SCRUM master who ran our team, this was a masters/grad student.

Descriptions of each game are in their respecive README's.
